MoonShell2 yslaunch aka ysloader multibyte

This is MoonShell2 extlink for YSMenu; write AUTO_BOOT then boot YSMenu.
This treats Unicode LFN, not SFN. So ROMs with multibyte character filename can be launched.

Use with YSMenu boot; otherwise when YSMenu is executed it will "AUTO_BOOT".

# Place config.ini to /moonshl2/extlink . I use the same style as linoul's ysloader.

As for AK2; MoonShell2 has to be launched from akmenu; otherwise akloader execution will fail in YSMenu.
Use "MoonShell2 Alternative Loader".

### Setting "autoboot" to 0 is not recommended.
